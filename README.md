# debian-setup
A guide for noobs by a noob to install debian and set it up the chiller way.

It is a mix between a script and a documentation.
So make sure to read the whole setup-razer.sh (especially the comments)
And then if you have a fresh debian system running you can execute it to finish the setup.

The script is designed for razer blade stealth.
And it adds some personal customizations.
So make sure you like what i use or make changes in the setup-razer.sh before executing it.
